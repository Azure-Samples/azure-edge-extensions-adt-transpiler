# DTDL Transpiler

The DTDL Transpiler is a framework consisting of Decorators for TypeScript classes, methods, and properties to map the classes to DTDL Interfaces, Properties, Relationships, and Telemetry. This allows developers to manage their DTDL ontology as code elements similar to a code first ORM like Entity Framework or TypeORM.

## Features

This project framework provides the following features:

* DTDL Decorators for marking up TypeScript Classes as DTDL Entities
* A generator that creates DTDL from Decorated classes
* Supports class hierarchies (extends), relationships, properties, and telemetry
